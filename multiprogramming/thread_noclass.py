Threads for the impatient
    No class needed (created "behind the scenes")
    For simple applications
    For many threading tasks, all you need is a run() method and maybe some arguments to pass to it.
    For simple tasks, you can just create an instance of Thread, passing in positional or keyword arguments
    Syntax
        threading.Thread(target=<some_function>, args=(<some_args,))
