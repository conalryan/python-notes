    Element
        An XML document consists of a single element, which contains sub-elements, which can have further sub-elements inside them.
        Elements are indicated by tags in the text.
        Tags are always inside angle brackets < >.
        Elements can either contain content, or they can be empty.
        Tags can contain attributes, indicated by attribute="value".
        Tags can either appear in begin/end pairs, in which the end tag starts with a slash, or as a single tag, in which case the tag ends with a slash.
        Attributes must be surrounded by double quotes.
        All tag names and attribute names should be lower case.
