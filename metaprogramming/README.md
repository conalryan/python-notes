# Metaprogramming
  Writing code that writes (or at least modifies) code
  Includes fetching, changing, or deleting attributes, and writing functions that return functions (aka factories)
  Can simplify some kinds of programs
  Not as hard as you think
  Considered deep magic in other languages
  Python provides explicit access to objects, even the parts that are hidden or restricted in other languages

# Decorators
  Classic design pattern
  Built into Python, many decorators are provided by the standard library, such as property() or classmethod()
  Implemented via functions or classes
  Can decorate functions or classes
  Can take parameters (but not required to)
  functools.wraps() preserves function's properties
  @ sign is used to apply a decorator to a function or class
  Decorator is a component that modifies some other component
  Purpose is typically to add functionality, but there are no restrictions on what decorator can do
  Many decorators register a component with some other component (e.g. @app.route() in Flask maps URL to view function)

Decorator                       Description
--------------------------------------------
@abc.abstractmethod             Indicate abstract method (must be implemented).

@abc.abstractproperty           Indicate abstract property (must be implemented).

@asyncio.coroutine              Mark generator-based coroutine.

@atexit.register                Register function to be executed when interpreter (script) exits.

@classmethod                    Indicate class method (receives class object, not instance object)

@contextlib.contextmanager      Define factory function for with statement context managers (no need to create enter() and exit() methods)

@functools.lru_cache            Wrap a function with a memoizing callable

@functools.singledispatch       Transform function into a single-dispatch generic function.

@functools.total_ordering       Supply all other comparison methods if class defines at least one.

@functools.wraps                Invoke update_wrapper() so decorator’s replacement function keeps original function’s name and other properties.

@property                       Indicate a class property.

@staticmethod                   Indicate static method (passed neither instance nor class object).

@types.coroutine                Transform generator function into a coroutine function.

@unittest.mock.patch            Patch target with a new object. When the function/with statement exits patch is undone.

@unittest.mock.patch.dict       Patch dictionary (or dictionary-like object), then restore to original state after test.

@unittest.mock.patch.multiple   Perform multiple patches in one call.

@unittest.mock.patch.object     Patch object attribute with mock object.
