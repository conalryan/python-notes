Classes
    Represents a thing (such as file, process, database record, strategy, string, person, truck, etc.)

    Creator of object instances
    Basic unit of object-oriented programming
    Class describes
        Data
            Class data
                Shared by all instances of the class
            Instance data
                Represents one instance of the thing and only accessible from that instance
        Methods
            Functions that act upon the data
    Note
        If you just need some functions, and they don't need to share or remember data, just put the functions in a module.
        If you just need some data, but don't need functions to process it, just use a nested structure (dictionaries, lists, tuples).
    Syntax
        class ClassName(base_class,...):
            # class body - methods and data
    StudlyCaps for ClassName
    Class definition creates a new local namespace
    All variable assignments go into this new namespace
    All methods are called via the instance or the class name

    No access modifiers - everything in Python class is public although underscore indicates private like javascript

        __str__ string method, similar to toString in Java

Object Instances
    Class class name as a function
    self contains attributes
    Syntax
        obj = ClassName(args...)
    Methods and data accessed using dot notation (e.g. obj_instance.some_method())
    Instance attributes are dynamic; they can be accessed directly from the object. You can create, update, and delete attributes in this way.
    Each object instance has its own private attributes, which are usually created in the __init__ method.
    Privacy by convention (_name)
    Attributes cannot be made private, but names that begin with an underscore are understood by convention to be for internal use only.
    Users of your class will not consider methods that begin with an underscore to be part of your class's API.
    In most cases, it is better to use properties to access data attributes

Instance Methods
    Called from objects
    Object is implicit parameter
    An instance method is a function defined in a class. When a method is called from an object, the object is passed
    in as the implicit first parameter, named self by strong convention.

Constructors
    Optional
    Named __init__
    If class defines method named __init__ it will be automatically called when an object instance is created
    The object being created is implicitly passed as the first parameters to __init__
    Named self by strong convention (same as this in C++, Java, C#)
    Data attributes can be assigned to self
    These attributes can then be accessed by other methods

Properties
    Accessed like variables

    It is accessed directly just as normal attributes, but getter, setter and deleter functions are implicitly called
    Getter Property

    Called from class or instance

Static Methods

    A static method is a utility method that is related to the class, but does not need the instance or class object. Thus, it has no automatic parameter.
    One use case for static methods is to factor some kind of logic out of several methods, when the logic doesn't require any of the data in the class.

Special Methods
    User-defined classes emulate standard types
    Define behavior for builtin functions
    Override operators
    Expect self parameter, like all instance methods
    self is the object being called from the builtin function, or left operand of a binary operator such as ==
    Frequently take one or more additional parameters.
    Example
        Have str() return hostanme, port of a database connection rather than something like <main.DBConn object at 0x782c6c>
